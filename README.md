In this data engineering project, I build and automate an ETL process that can extract current weather data from open weather map API, transform the data and load the data into an S3 bucket. I used Apache Airflow for orchestrating and scheduling workflows of tasks and data pipelines. This project will be entirely carried out on AWS cloud platform.
For deploying the code i used Amazon S3 Bucket.

Skills Used: Apache Airflow, Python, API, EC2 Instance, Amazon S3 Bucket, DBT Tools, Pandas, SQL
